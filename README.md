This project analyzes the health factors, demographics factors, and lifestyle behaviors that most influence the risk of having a stroke.  We initially posed the question of whether or not smoking affected the risk for stroke.  We also wanted to know what the top factors for increased risk of stroke are, and whether lifestyle behaviors beyond smoking, like diet and physical activity have any effect on stroke occurrence.

Questions
Does smoking affect risk of stroke?
What are the top demograhic and health factors that affect risk of stroke?
Do lifestyles behaviors other than smoking (i.e. diet and excercise) effect the likelihood of stroke?

Process
After isolating the data for smoking and stroke diagnoses, we found that there was no clear correlation between smoking habit and the likelihood of having a stroke. Only 42 of 249 who were diagnosed with a stroke reported that they smoked at all.  We then sorted the data for risk factors in order to find the more prominent in the list.  We found that age, hypertension, heart disease, glucose level, and BMI were top factors among the datasets that we used.

Hypertension and Heart Disease
For these categories we calculated the percentage of the population of people who had had strokes that also had either condition.  We found that 26% of people who have had strokes had heart disease and 19% of them had hypertension.

BMI
When separating the different categories for BMI and finding the number of people in ecah category had been diagnosed with a stroke, we saw a clear relationship between BMI and stroke occurrence.  As BMI rose, so did the likelihood of having a stroke.  We found that of the population that had been diagnosed with strokes, 0.5% percent were underweight, compared with 16.7% for healthy BMI, 35.9% for overweight BMI, and then almost have of the stroke population at 46.9% were in the obese BMI category. The largest number of stroke occurences are among those in the overweight and obese categories of BMI, with the percentage of strokes in the obese BMI category being almost three times the percentage of those with a healthy BMI. We can conclude from the data that BMI is a significant factor in the likelihood of having a stroke.

Age
We also calculated the number of people in different age categories who had been diagnosed with a stroke. The data for age and stroke occurence shows a definite correlation as well. The percentage of strokes in the 50's and 60's age ranges, 19.6% and 19.1% respectively, are almost four times that of the 40's age range which made up only 5.7% of the population diagnosed with a stroke, and the percentage for the 70's age range, at 52.6% is almost ten times that of the 40' age group. It's fairly easy to conclude here that age is a major factor in risk for stroke. After a person reaches their 50's there is a major increase in the likelihood of having a stroke, and this likelihood more than doubles when a person reaches their 70's.

Glucose Level
When separating the different categories for glucose level and finding the number of people in each category had been diagnosed with a stroke, we also see that increase in glucose level correlates with a higher prevalence of stroke.  The percentage of the population of people who had strokes and low blood sugar is far less than both those with normal glucose levels and diabetic glucose levels. It is interesting that people with a healthy glucose level still made up 34.4% of the population who had strokes, but you can also see that a diabetic glucose level still accounts for significantly more of the population who have had strokes.

Physical Activity Level
We did not find a correlation in the data between physical activity and stroke likelihood, across all reported activity levels, stroke occurence remained relatively the same.  There is more or less an even 30% of the stroke population divided between the categories (low, moderate, and high).

Diet
Similarly to activity level, we did not find a correlation with stroke occurence and diet. Diet does not seem to have much impact on the likelihood of stroke. If anything, we do see that the paleo diet accounts for the largest percentage of people who have had strokes at 14.9% while the vegetarian diet is the lowest at 13.8%. It could possibly be concluded from this information, since the paleo diet is meat protein heavy, that not eating meat would decrease your change of having a stroke, except that the vegan diet accounts for a higher percentage of the population who have had strokes (14.4%) than the non-vegetarian (14.3%), pescatarian (14.0%), and gluten-free diets (14.1%). Overall, all diets seem to more or less split the population of people who have had strokes evenly, at around 14% each.

Blood Pressure
We ran statistical testing on blood pressure as well and likewise found no correlation with stroke occurence.

Conclusions
We concluded with the data that smoking does not present an increased risk in the likelihood of stroke, and neither do other lifestyle factors like diet and exercise.  The three largest factors in predicting risk of stroke appear to be age, BMI, and glucose level.
